        <p><strong>DHL[4]</strong> is an American-founded German logistics company[5][6] providing courier, package delivery and express mail service, delivering over 1.8 billion parcels per year.[7] A subsidiary of the German logistics firm Deutsche Post, its express mail service DHL Express is one of the market leaders for parcel services in Europe and Germany's main Courier and Parcel Service.[8]</p>
<p>The company DHL itself was founded in San Francisco, United States, in 1969 and expanded its service throughout the world by the late 1970s. In 1979, under the name of DHL Air Cargo, the company entered the Hawaiian islands with an inter-island cargo service using two DC-3 and four DC-6 aircraft. Adrian Dalsey and Larry Hillblom personally oversaw the daily operations until its eventual bankruptcy closed the doors in 1983. At its peak, DHL Air Cargo employed just over 100 workers, management and pilots</p>

           <p>DHL has taken measures to control their environmental effect by use of alternative fuel vehicles. DHL changed vehicles in certain delivery fleets in order to use alternative fuels. Certain new vehicles use compressed natural gas, to which DHL hopes to convert 50% of their vehicles in the future.</p>
